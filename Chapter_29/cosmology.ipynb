    "## Newtonian Cosmology\n",
    "On December 27, 1831, the *Beagle* sailed out of Plymouth, England and was crowded with $74$ people, one of whom was Charles Darwin.  During stops in South America, the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia, he exercised his formidable powers of observation.  In 1859, Darwin published **[On the Origin of Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species)**, which marked the first time people began to comprehend their own origins from a naturalistic perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other discoveries followed during the next 100 years, with careful observations and brilliant deductions uncovering more about our beginnings.  The discovery of DNA and plate tectonics revealed the mechanism by which we and our planet evolved.  The ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis explained the manufacture of the chemical elements by stars, implying the origin of our corporeal bodies and the ground on which we walk.  Even the universe itself was found to be expanding.  In 1964, two researchers at Bell Laboratories measured the afterglow of the Big Bang, which provided compelling evidence for the explosive origin of everything in existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosmology is the study of the origin and evolution of the universe.  However, there isn't a single perspective for us to consider.  Some insights can be gained by discussing the expansion of the universe through Newtonian mechanics, the discovery and implications of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the introduction of a geometrical universe through general relativity, and some key parameters that may be measured observationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Olber's Paradox\n",
    "Newton believed in an infinite static universe filled with a uniform scattering of stars.  If the distribution of matter did not extend forever, then it would collapse inward due to its own self-gravity.  However, Edmund Halley worried about a sky filled with an infinite number of stars.  Why then, *is the sky dark at night?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This question was posed most strongly by [Heinrich Olbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Wilhelm_Matthias_Olbers). Olbers argued (in 1823) that \n",
    "- if we live in an infinite, transparent universe filled with stars, \n",
    "- then in any direction one looks in the night sky, one's line of sight will fall on the surface of a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conclusion is valid regardless of whether the stars are uniformly distributed or grouped in galaxies.  Olbers' argument was so strong that its disagreement with the obvious fact that the night sky was indeed dark became known as **Olbers' paradox**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Olbers believed that the answer to this paradox was that space is not transparent.  The ideas of thermodynamics were still being developed at that time, and Olbers could not appreciate that is answer was incorrect.  The flaw was that any obscuring matter hiding the stars beyond would be heated up by the starlight until it glowed as brightly as a stellar surface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, the first essentially correct answer came from Edgar Allan Poe (see this [history](https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/journey-to-the-stars/educator-resources/stars/olbers-paradox)).  Poe proposed that because light has a finite speed and the universe is not infinitely old, then the light from the most distant sources has not yet arrived.  This solution was independently put on a firm scientific foundation by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson).  In more modern terms, the solution to Olbers' paradox is that our universe is simply too young for it to be filled with light.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "It is sometimes argued that the cosmological redshift caused by the expansion of the universe is responsible for the darkness of the night sky because it shifts starlight out of the visible spectrum.  In fact, this effect is much too small to contribute significantly to a dark night sky.\n",
    "```\n",
    "### The Cosmological Principle\n",
    "Hubble's law appears as a natural outcome of an expanding universe that is both *isotropic* and *homogenous* (i.e., appearing the same in all directions and at all locations).  This crucial assumption of an isotropic and homogenous universe is called the **cosmological principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that the expansion of the universe appears the same to all observers at all locations, consider a triangle with the Earth at the origin of the coordinate system and two galaxies ($A$ and $B$) located at the other two vertices.  The galaxies can be located along two sides of the triangle using the position vectors $\\mathbf{r}_A$ and $\\mathbf{r}_B$ for galaxy $A$ and $B$, respectively.  The other side of the triangle can then be defined by the difference vector $\\mathbf{r}_B - \\mathbf{r}_A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Hubble's law, the recessional velocities of the two galaxies are described using the respective position vectors as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}_A &= H_o \\mathbf{r}_A, \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}_B &= H_o \\mathbf{r}_B.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The recessional velocity of galaxy $B$ as seen by an observer in galaxy $A$ is therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " \\mathbf{v}_B - \\mathbf{v}_A &= H_o\\mathbf{r}_B - H_o\\mathbf{r}_A, \\\\\n",
    " &= H_o\\left(\\mathbf{r}_B - \\mathbf{r}_A, \\right),\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "so the observer in galaxy $A$ sees all of the other galaxies in the universe moving away with recessional velocities described by the *same* Hubble's law as on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the value of the Hubble \"constant\" $H_o$ is assumed to be equivalent for all observers, it is actually a function of time $H(t)$.  If the present time is $t_o$, then $H_o \\equiv H(t_o).$"

    "### A Simple Pressureless \"Dust\" Model of the Universe\n",
    "To develop an understanding of how the expansion of the universe varies with time, imagine a universe with a pressureless \"dust\" of uniform density $\\rho(t)$ and choose an arbitrary point for the origin.  Unlike the actual universe, this model universe is both perfectly isotropic and homogenous at all scales.  The pressureless dust represents all of the matter in the universe after being homogenized and uniformly dispersed.\n",
